    AraPath= "D:/UNSW COURSE/COMP9517/pro1_indi/Plant_Phenotyping_Datasets (1)/Plant_Phenotyping_Datasets/Plant/Ara2013-Canon"

    TobaccoPath= "D:/UNSW COURSE/COMP9517/pro1_indi/Plant_Phenotyping_Datasets (1)/Plant_Phenotyping_Datasets/Plant/Tobacco"
 
In my computer, as this two dataset, Ara2013-Canon and Tobacco file is in this file, I set this path in my py. file



please reset the AraPath and TobaccomPath as where your Ara2013-Canon and Tobacco file located in.
